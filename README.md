Learch: a Learning-based Strategies for Path Exploration in Symbolic Execution
=============================================================================================================

Learch is a learning-based state selection strategy for symbolic execution. It can achieve significantly more coverage and detects more security violations than existing manual heuristics. Learch is instantiated on [KLEE](http://klee.github.io/). The directory `klee` contains our modified KLEE code (from [this commit](https://github.com/klee/klee/tree/95ce1601c380341ef3b1043644c66be754e345c0)) and `learch` contains the Learch code. Learch is developed at [SRI Lab, Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/) as part of the [Machine Learning for Programming](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/research/plml) project. For more details, please refer to [Learch CCS'21 paper](https://files.sri.inf.ethz.ch/website/papers/ccs21-learch.pdf).

## Setup
We provide a [docker file](Dockerfile), which we recommend to start with. To set Learch up locally, one can follow the instructions in the [docker file](Dockerfile). To build and run:
```
$ docker build -t learch .
$ docker run -it learch
```

## Usages
The following README files explains how to use Learch:
* Obtaining the benchmarks used in the paper: [`benchmarks/README.md`](benchmarks/README.md).
* Training Learch: [`train/README.md`](train/README.md).
* Using Learch to test new programs: [`eval/README.md`](eval/README.md).
